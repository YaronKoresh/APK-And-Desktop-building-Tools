* Create functions that will get argument & will generate pages, inside "app.js" - similar to "Menu" & "List" functions (you can delete them)
* Pass arguments to generate pages from those functions, inside "app.js", with "App" function - you can generate multiple pages per function
* Insert all-pages content (like for: header & footer), inside the "<body>" tags of "index.html" - all content will appear on every generated page
* Edit "icon.png" & "favicon.png" with picture manipulation software (GIMP|Windows-Paint|etc...)
* Upload into "Snacks" (inside expo.dev), any needed file (do not upload "tools/" nor "barcode.png")
* Fix any problem (use the automatic fixes of the "panel", when possible)
* Install NodeJS (nodejs.org/en/download)
* install expo command line interface (expo-cli_install.bat)
* Enable WSL (WSL.ps1 - run as administrator)
* Download your snack as a ZIP file & get from it the app.json
* Build & publish it into the stores (android.bat/ios.bat)

=> The file "barcode.png" is for live preview of the code, Scan it using the app: "Expo Go"
